## Supported YAML Metadata

The `quarto-gradio` extension processes the following YAML metadata:

```yml
gradio:
    # @gradio/lite CDN base
    cdn: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@gradio/lite"
    
    # @gradio/lite version
    version: "latest"                                
    
    # Deps to pass to <gradio-requirements/>
    requirements:                                    
        - plotly==5.24.0
    
    # List of attributes to pass to <gradio-lite/> tag
    attributes:              
        # Optional: "dark" or "light"
        theme: dark          
        
        # Optional: true or false
        shared-worker: false 
        
        # Optional: true or false
        playground: false    
        
        # Optional: "horizontal" or "vertical"
        layout: horizontal   
```

The extension is solely responsible for passing this metadata to appropriate HTML tags defined by [@gradio/lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gradio/lite){target=_blank} package. For a more detailed explanation of metadata semantics, please refer to the [Gradio Lite documentation](https://www.gradio.app/guides/gradio-lite){target=_blank}.

## Supported Python Requirement Formats

You can consult the [ðŸ“¦ Customize Python Modules](../guide/customize-python-modules/) guide for an example of how to use the `requirements` metadata.

| Format             | Description                                      | Example                                             |

## Document Processing Flow

The main idea behind this extension is to hook into the lifecycle of the Quarto document at the stage where it is represented as a [Pandoc Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)](https://pandoc.org/filters.html){target=_blank}, collect all the source code from Python code blocks and dynamically construct the appropriate HTML tree by populating the `<gradio-requirements/>` and `<gradio-lite/>` tags.
