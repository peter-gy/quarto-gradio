This guide will demonstrate how you can embed a Gradio app into a Reveal.js presentation.

## Minimal Example

Embedding Gradio Lite apps into Reveal.js presentations is extremely similar to embedding them into other HTML-based Quarto documents. The main difference is that the following Quarto options must be specified at the cell-level:

```python
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
```

````md
{{< src-include reveal-gradio-lite-minimal.qmd >}}
````

<iframe src="./reveal-gradio-lite-minimal.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

## Complex Example

Thanks to all the existing Quarto + Reveal.js features, the presentation can be customized to the n<sup>th</sup> degree, as described in the [Quarto Reveal.js documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/).

<iframe src="./reveal-gradio-lite.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
